# web-dev-starter

This is a starter project for web development with no frameworks and minimal
dependencies. It is intended to be a starting point for web development projects
that are written in plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Getting Started

To get started, clone this repository and run the following commands:

```bash
npm install
```
This will install the necessary dependencies for the project.

## Development

It is recommended to use the VSCode Live Server extension to run the project
locally. This will allow you to see changes in real-time as you make them. There
is no need to run a build process or refresh the page manually. Additionally,
you do not need to setup a local server to run the project.

## Testing

To run the tests for the project, run the following command in the terminal:

npm test

## Running the Website

To run the website, please clone the repository that contains the code for the site or download a copy of it. Please then open the repository in a code application like VScode(with the Live server app installed or your choice of web server application). Please then start the web server using the following command: "Live Preview: Start Server" when you are on the index.html file. This should be all that is neccassary to view the website, as a new window show pop up that would allow you to preview and interact with the site.
